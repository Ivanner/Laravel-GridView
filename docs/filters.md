# Laravel GridView Filters

Filters allows user to filter data in the grid by some conditions. 
Currently there is a single method in `BaseFilter` but please note that there'll be added an extra method for input validation/etc. Consider this when update to newer versions.

Currently available:
- DropdownFilter (alias: dropdown)
- TextFilter (alias: text)
